This is a test project written completely in Python using Fastht.ml to accomplish as much as possible. My goal at the onset
was to write this program without any Javascript, but in the end I caved and wrote about 15-20 lines. Mostly this was dues to
the return of status 204 with no body from the post to S3.  This was technically developped against Railway's Object Storage, 
but there should be no differences if you were to use AWS directly.  

## Running
Simply run python main.py and the server will come up.

## Deployment
